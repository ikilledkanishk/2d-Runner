# 🏃 2D Running Game

A small 2D animated running game built using basic web technologies.  
Created as a learning and experimentation project, with equal parts curiosity, logic, and vibe coding.

This project does not aim to revolutionize gaming. It aims to run. And it does.

## 🎮 Overview
- Simple 2D side-scrolling runner
- Basic character animation
- Lightweight gameplay mechanics
- Runs directly in the browser with no setup drama

The focus was on understanding animation, movement logic, and game flow rather than building a feature-heavy game engine.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

No frameworks. No libraries. Just the basics doing their best.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Open the project folder  
3. Open index.html in any modern web browser  
4. Press keys. Observe movement. Feel accomplished.

## 📦 Project Status
This project is currently *experimental* and *unfinished*.  
It may be improved, refactored, or left alone depending on future motivation levels.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository exists to:
- Practice basic game development concepts
- Experiment with animations and logic
- Serve as a simple showcase of web-based game development
- Feel free to explore the code, learn from it, and experiment, but don’t rebrand it as your magnum opus.
